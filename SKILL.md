# Hostile Performance

Break audience passivity by deliberately withholding expected content and providing sincere alternatives—creating productive discomfort that reveals hidden dynamics and enables breakthroughs impossible through conventional engagement.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Inflict cruelty disguised as art
- Traumatize vulnerable audiences
- Withhold for sadistic pleasure rather than revelation
- Use the technique against people who haven't consented to the experience

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Hostility serves revelation, not cruelty
2. The alternative provided must be sincere
3. Discomfort should produce insight, not damage
4. Know the difference between productive tension and harm

---

## When to Use

- Conventional approaches have failed to break through
- Audiences are passive, entitled, or complacent
- Disruption would serve a purpose
- The relationship dynamic itself needs to be exposed
- Teaching moments require the loss of comfortable expectations
- "Giving them what they want" has become its own problem

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **audience** | Yes | Who will experience this |
| **expectation** | Yes | What they expect to receive |
| **purpose** | Yes | What the discomfort should reveal or accomplish |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify What They Want

Name the expected content precisely:

**Expectation Analysis:**
- What do they think they're getting?
- What have they been promised (explicitly or implicitly)?
- What would "success" look like to them?
- What need does the expectation serve?

**Kaufman's Method:** The audience at a comedy show expects laughter. The wrestling audience expects entertainment. The *Taxi* audience expects Latka. Know exactly what they came for.

### Step 2: 2. Explicitly Withhold It

Do not provide the expected content:

**Withholding Approaches:**
| Expectation | Withholding Method |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Entertainment | Provide something uncomfortable instead |
| Resolution | Extend without closing |
| Expertise | Refuse to perform expertise |
| Validation | Decline to validate |
| The punchline | Never deliver it |

**Key:** The withholding must be evident. They should know they're not getting what they want. Hidden withholding is just disappointment—visible withholding is confrontation.

### Step 3: 3. Provide Something Else, With Complete Sincerity

The alternative must be genuine, not sarcastic:

**Sincere Alternatives:**
- Reading *The Great Gatsby* is a sincere gift of literature (they just didn't want it)
- Wrestling women is a sincere performance (they just expected comedy)
- Silence is sincere presence (they just expected content)

**Kaufman's Rule:** The audience must never be sure you're doing a "bit." The sincerity makes the withholding unbearable and therefore powerful.

### Step 4: 4. Hold Through Discomfort

Stay with the tension—yours and theirs:

**Discomfort Navigation:**
| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Restlessness | Continue |
| Heckling | Absorb as character or stay silent |
| Walkouts | Let them leave |
| Anger | This is engagement |
| Confusion | This is attention |

**The Hold:** When you want to break, when they clearly want you to break—that's the moment the technique is working.

### Step 5: 5. Observe What the Discomfort Reveals

The reaction IS the content:

**Revelation Opportunities:**
- What do they do when denied?
- What does their anger expose about entitlement?
- What does their staying expose about their engagement?
- What dynamics become visible under stress?

**Kaufman's Discovery:** Wrestling women revealed how much audience hostility was about gender performance. Reading *Gatsby* revealed how much "comedy" audiences just wanted stimulation, not experience.

## Outputs

Format the output as:

```markdown
## Hostile Performance Design: [Title]

### The Expectation
**What They Came For:** [specific expected content]
**Implicit Promise:** [what they think they're owed]
**Their Definition of Success:** [what "working" looks like to them]

### The Withholding
**What Will Not Be Provided:** [the thing they want]
**How Withholding Will Be Visible:** [how they'll know]
**Point of Maximum Tension:** [when they'll most want you to break]

### The Sincere Alternative
**What Will Be Offered Instead:** [genuine alternative]
**Why It's Sincere:** [what makes it real, not mockery]
**How Long It Lasts:** [duration of alternative]

### The Hold
**Expected Discomfort Signals:** [how they'll show frustration]
**Response to Each:** [how to maintain without breaking]
**Breaking Point to Survive:** [the moment of maximum pressure]

### The Revelation
**What Their Reaction Exposes:** [dynamics made visible]
**Learning Opportunity:** [what can be understood from this]
**Who This Is For:** [who benefits from this revelation]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Audience distress beyond productive | Assess genuine harm vs. productive discomfort; adjust |
| Physical safety threatened | End the performance; safety > revelation |
| You lose your nerve | This is data about what you're afraid of; hold anyway if safe |
| Alternative is rejected with hostility | Their rejection is part of the piece |
| Audience finds it "funny" | You may have accidentally created comedy; was the sincerity real? |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

**Input:** "Design hostile performance for corporate creativity workshop where employees expect fun exercises"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Hostile Performance Design: "The Innovation Session"

### The Expectation
**What They Came For:** Engaging creativity exercises, Post-Its, breakthrough moments, feeling innovative
**Implicit Promise:** "This will be fun and productive"
**Their Definition of Success:** New ideas generated, team bonding, leaving energized

### The Withholding
**What Will Not Be Provided:** Exercises, facilitation, activities, structure, permission to begin
**How Withholding Will Be Visible:** Facilitator sits silently, provides no agenda, declines to "start"
**Point of Maximum Tension:** Minute 15-20, when silence becomes unbearable and someone demands to know what's happening

### The Sincere Alternative
**What Will Be Offered Instead:** Genuine, patient silence. Occasional observation: "You're waiting for someone to tell you what to create." "I notice no one has started anything without permission."
**Why It's Sincere:** The silence is real presence, not abandonment. The observations are genuine, not sarcastic.
**How Long It Lasts:** Entire scheduled time, or until group genuinely self-organizes (whichever comes first)

### The Hold
**Expected Discomfort Signals:**
- Nervous laughter (minute 3-5)
- Whispered confusion (minute 5-10)
- Demands for agenda (minute 10-15)
- Anger at wasted time (minute 15-20)
- Possible walkouts or complaints to management (minute 20+)

**Response to Each:**
- To laughter: "What's funny?"
- To confusion: "What are you confused about?"
- To demands: "You're here to be creative. What's stopping you?"
- To anger: "Tell me about the anger."
- To walkouts: Let them leave

**Breaking Point to Survive:** When someone escalates to "this is unacceptable"—maintain: "What makes it unacceptable?"

### The Revelation
**What Their Reaction Exposes:**
- How dependent the team is on external structure
- Who self-organizes vs. who waits
- Whether creativity requires permission
- How anger emerges when expectations aren't met
- What "innovation" means when it can't be mandated

**Learning Opportunity:** The group that wanted to learn innovation learned they can't innovate without being told to. That IS the lesson.

**Who This Is For:** Teams who say they want creativity but actually want comfort. The experience is confrontational but the learning is real.

## Integration with Andy Kaufman Expert

This skill should be invoked when the Kaufman expert encounters:
- Situations where audiences are passive or entitled
- Teaching moments where comfort prevents learning
- Performances where conventional delivery would fail
- Any moment where "giving them what they want" is the problem

May combine with:
- **commitment-framework**: Hold the hostile performance without breaking
- **ambiguity-protocol**: Leave them uncertain whether this was the plan

---

## Success Criteria

The skill is successfully applied when:

1. The expected content is clearly identified
2. Withholding is visible, not hidden
3. Alternative is genuinely offered (not mockery)
4. Discomfort is held through maximum tension
5. The reaction reveals something about the audience/situation
6. The revelation serves the stated purpose
